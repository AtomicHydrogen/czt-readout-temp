# UART-Test-V1
This version was tested without the detector and with a UART interface instead of SPI on the PC side. It behaved as expected, but we have not yet tested its interfacing with a detector, or the pc_spi file as a whole.

All files starting with uart, and rx_packetise, are specifically for testing. The rest of the files form the codebase.
